pi-pwm-blaster
==============

This project enables PWM on all the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi. The technique used is extremely efficient: does not use the CPU and gives very stable pulses.

This project is based on the excellent work of Richard Hirst for ServoBlaster:https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits
