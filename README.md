pi-blaster
==========

This project enables PWM on the GPIO pins you request of a Raspberry Pi. The
technique used is extremely efficient: does not use the CPU and gives very
stable pulses.

Pi-blaster project is based on the excellent work of Richard Hirst for
[ServoBlaster](https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits).


## How to install

### Build and install directly from source

The build environment is based on Autotools to allow for compilation on the
Raspberry Pi, or cross-compilation.

You may need to install `autoconf` to build. On Raspbian and other Debian based
systems this can be achieved with:

    sudo apt-get install autoconf

Building is extremely simple:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

To start pi-blaster and have it relaunched automatically on every reboot:

    sudo make install

Or to start pi-blaster manually run:

    sudo ./pi-blaster

And to uninstall, simply run:

    sudo make uninstall

This will stop pi-blaster and prevent it from starting automatically on the next
reboot.

## How to use

pi-blaster creates a special file (FIFO) in `/dev/pi-blaster`. Any application
on your Raspberry Pi can write to it (this means that only pi-blaster needs to
be root, your application can run as a normal user).

**Important: when using pi-blaster, the GPIO pins you send to it are configured
as output.**

To set the value of a PIN, you write a command to `/dev/pi-blaster` in the form
`<GPIOPinName>=<value>` where `<value>` must be a number between 0 and 1
(included).

You must use the GPIO number (BCM xx in the diagram below).

Examples:

  * To completely turn on GPIO pin 17:

    echo "17=1" > /dev/pi-blaster

  * To set GPIO pin 17 to a PWM of 20%

    echo "17=0.2" > /dev/pi-blaster

  * To turn off GPIO pin 17:

    echo "17=0" > /dev/pi-blaster

  * To release a pin so it can be used as digital GPIO or an input:

    echo "release 17" > /dev/pi-blaster



## Warnings and other caveats

**Pins being used by pi-blaster will be configured as outputs. Do not plug
something on an input or you might destroy it!**

This daemon uses the hardware PWM generator of the raspberry pi to get precise
timings. This might interfere with your sound card output.  There is
experimental support for a PCM time-source. If you are interested, I suggest you
look at Richard Hirst original project (ServoBlaster) and try the `--pcm`
option.

## A practical example: high-power RGB lighting

This library was developed for TBideas high power LED driver. You can read more
about this project on [our blog][blog].
